A sample dataset for running LSST DM stack
==========================================

This directory contains the input files and astrometric reference catalogs
need to to process a simulated LSST CCD, using processCcdLsstSim.py script
from the pipe_tasks package of LSST Data Management Stack.

To run the example, do:

	source $LSST_HOME/loadLSST.sh
	setup pipe_tasks
	./bin/demo.sh

where $LSST_HOME isn the directory where your LSST DM stack resides.

Look at the contents of demo.sh to get an understanding of how to run
processCcd scripts.

All outputs (calibrated images, raw lists of detected sources, etc.) will be
stored in ./output subdirectory.  These are "raw" outputs, readable by other
parts of the LSST pipeline. 

In detected-sources.txt, you'll find an ASCII whitespace separated list of
detected sources and their measured attributes.  This may be more useful for
post-processing purposes.  This file can be compared to
detected-sources.expected -- their contents should be identical.
